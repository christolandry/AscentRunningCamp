# Happy-Tails
This is a website for a summer camp for high school cross country runners.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Remodeled a few sections of the webpage, added in the google maps location of the camp into the footer and all around expanded it to fit was need for the camp.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson was finding the correct position in the CSS to maniuplate the FAQ section.  It was using nth child selectors and additional selectors needed to be accounted for.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
