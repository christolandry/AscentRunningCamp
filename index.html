								<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
								<!-- <p>Camp is open to athletes entering 8th - 12th grade</p> -->
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Age Range</h3>
									<p>Camp is open to athletes entering 8th - 12th grade</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Covid Protocols</h3>
									<p>We will follow all local, state and federal Covid-19 protocols that are in place at the time of the camp.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>Check In/Out</h3>
									<p>If necessary, campers can come late or leave early during camp to meet family needs, however we must have prior written permission from a guardian. Check-in will be from 1:00-3:00 pm at the housing site. Check out will be from 9:00-11:00am at the housing site.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What will workouts be like?</h3>
									<p>Given the potential of warm weather, our primary efforts will take place in the mornings. These morning runs will include longer distance runs, and the option to participate in light introductions to tempo runs, fartleks, hill running, and other types of workouts that will advance your fitness and prepare you well for the season.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>How hard is camp?</h3>
									<p>Since it is early in the season, we are always conscious of easing runners into their fall training, and don’t insist on twice a day running. Instead, in the afternoons, campers will either go for a light run, or participate in a cross training activity of some kind. We find this approach is excellent at advancing camper’s fitness, while ensuring they arrive to their first day of official practice healthy and energized.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What do you do other than running?</h3>
									<p>In addition to these two main workouts each day, there will be skills sessions and other opportunities for campers to learn and practice speed and form drills, body-weight/general strength exercises, with videotaping and analysis done during these periods.</p>
									<p>During free time blocks, counselors and campers may organize games (indoor and outdoor), visit the pool, or grab a nap (a popular choice).</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What kind of programming does the camp offer?</h3>
									<p>Our years of experience at running camps has taught us that there’s a lot more to running camp than just the running, or trotting out guest speakers to give lectures to tired campers.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag">
									<h3>What will we eat?</h3>
									<p>Campers will eat all meals in the Lees-McRae dining hall starting with dinner on Sunday and concluding with breakfast on Friday, where they will have access to nutritious and runner-friendly meals.</p>
									<p>We are always cautious of the nutritional and health challenges facing runners, and issues associated with nutrition and running. We look forward to communicating with athletes and parents to ensure that we can support the needs of any athlete while they are at camp.</p>

									<p>At Ascent Running Camp, we are invested in providing generative, small group programming that will help athletes connect, learn about their sport, and prepare for the coming season, and a lifetime of running. Our scheduled programming includes small group breakout sessions led by coaches and educators and covering a variety of topics (e.g. injury prevention, nutritional planning, sports psychology), as well as skills sessions focused on fine-tuning form and providing individualized coaching attention, a roundtable with college counselors, and thoughtfully chosen, engaging guest speakers. Campers will leave having done some great running, but also having learned a great amount about how to BE a runner.</p>
									<p>Beyond this, each evening, and some days, we design more traditional ‘summer camp’ type programming that helps build camaraderie, and shape lasting friendships. This includes a Camp Olympics, with a variety of safe and fun challenges, as well as a group Lip Sync competition, Skits, and teambuilding challenges.</p>
